Crystalline Project is an osu! Software specialize in safety, hence absence of features.

## Current Status
- **Undetected since 2019**

## Features
- **Enlighten**: Remove Flashlight, Hidden and change Approach Rate (AR)
- **StreamProof**: OBS Game Capture Bypass
- **Undetectable**: More info about this on [Discord](https://discord.gg/CWAM8TFbxb).

## Supported Clients
- **osu!**
- **osu!lazer**
- **McOsu**
- **Most private server clients**

## Supported OS
- **Windows 10**
- **Windows 11**

The rest is unknown, though I'm pretty sure it won't work on Linux nor Apple; basically anything that doesn't start their title with **Windows** shouldn't work and vice versa.
